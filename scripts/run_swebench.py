I've uploaded a python code repository in your current directory, this will be the repository for you to investigate and make code changes.

## Problem Statement
$problem_statement

## Your Task
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the problem statement are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the problem statement. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the $${working_dir} directory to ensure the problem statement is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the problem statement
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduction script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edge cases and make sure your fix handles them as well

**Note**: this is a HARD problem, which means you need to think HARD! Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
**Note**: you are not allowed to modify project dependency files like `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` or `package.json`

## Exit Criteria
Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.
    1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
    If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
    If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.

    2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).

    3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
    You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.

    4. Commit your change, make sure you only have one commit.
Plz make sure you commit your change at the end, otherwise I won't be able to export your change.
